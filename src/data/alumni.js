  //   quote: "The word I would use to describe Zicklin students would be motivated. Everyone in my program wanted to be there. They were investing their own time, their own money, and really what they were investing was themselves. The program really gave me a different way to think about the business world.",

    quote: "Culture matters. Many schools can offer you a wonderful degree, but the culture of a school and how it forms you are the special sauce. When I went to Zicklin, I wasn't the only one getting up at 4 am to commute to the city, work all day, study at night, and do my homework in Penn Station. The grit, determination, integrity, and diversity of the student body all shape culture. The students at Zicklin come from all walks of life – different countries, economic backgrounds, and experiences – and opened my eyes to a world outside of myself. Zicklin is beyond the wonderful degree you'll obtain, it forms you into the leader you want to become. At Zicklin, the culture is real."

    quote: "A big part of the reason I applied to Zicklin was the diversity. That's so important to me as a business owner. I'm all about inclusivity. It's one thing to learn a topic and skills. It's another layer when you learn through the different perspectives of people from different parts of the world or with different life experiences. I'm a biracial man who never felt like I fit in anywhere. Finally, at Zicklin I could fit in and yet stand out. It really made a difference.",

    quote: "It was a very rewarding experience. There was such a diversity of backgrounds — I had a computer science and engineering background, one classmate was an opera singer, another was in advertising, another had been a director. When we worked together in teams, we benefited so much from the different ways people think. And nobody missed a deadline! All my friends from Zicklin are now climbing the corporate ladder, making a name for themselves. It's the work ethic — I'd never seen people who were so hardworking."
